Swap logger

Swap logger is a command line frame rate measurement tool for EGL and X11
applications. To use it, launch the application you wish to measure with the
'swaplogger' command:

    $ swaplogger my_app

Frame rate information will now be printed to the console as the application
runs. The output fields are:

    source      Component that triggered the swap (EGL, XSHM, XDMG)
    frame       Frame number since program start or reset
    dur         Duration of current frame in milliseconds
    ifps        Instantaneous FPS (frames per second) for current frame
    min         Minimum FPS since start or reset
    max         Maximum FPS since start or reset
    afps_N      Average FPS in previous N frames
    afps        Average FPS since start or reset

See the help ('swaplogger --help') for further information and more advanced
use cases.
